# Serverless-Computing-Framework
A serverless computing platform inspired by AWS Lambda. This project provides a functions-as-a-service (FaaS) implementation where code is executed in response to events. It utilizes Docker for function isolation and Kubernetes for orchestration, and integrates RabbitMQ for event-driven architecture and asynchronous task processing.
